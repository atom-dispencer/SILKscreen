== SILKscreen ==

The name 'SILKscreen' is comprised of two parts: 'SILK' stands for 'Software In the Loop Kernel', 
and a 'silkscreen' is the top visible layer of a PCB (Printed Circuit Board).

SILKscreen is an API and daemon which allows virtual testing of embedded applications. It aims to 
solve the problem of developing embedded applications without access to the hardware, and is 
intended to create a deliberately imperfect environment with the ability to emulate hardware and
protocol errors.

Many hardware vendors provide layers of abstraction over hardware functions, such as
ST Microelectronic's 'HAL', Texas Instruments' 'TivaWare', or the Arduino standard library, however
developers using these are dependent on the relevant hardware being available to be able to test
their code.

== Components ==

SILKscreen Daemon:
  An application which runs in the background and replaces the hardware target.

SILKscreen API:
  A generic API for communicating with the SILKscreen daemon.

Platform API:
  A platform-specific API which the user must implement in their own use-case. The Platform API can
  makes calls to the SILKscreen API to emulate/replace any required hardware functionality, and
  can be used to opt in/out of SILKscreen.
  For example, a Platform API for an STM32 application which communicates via SPI might define a
  function which 'transmits' 1 byte and 'receives' 5 bytes.

== Usage ==

The user must include the SILKscreen API, implement their own Platform API, then link against the 
final executable with the 'libsilkscreen' binary.
